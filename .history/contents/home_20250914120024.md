I am currently pursuing my M.E. degree in **Medical Artificial Intelligence** at **Southern Medical University, China**, under the supervision of **Prof. Shulong Li**.  
I received my B.E. degree in **Software Engineering** from the **University of South China** in 2024.  

I am passionate about both medicine and computer science, and I hope to contribute meaningful work at the intersection of these fields.
